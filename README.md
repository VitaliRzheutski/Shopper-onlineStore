## Getting started

2. `npm install`.
3. Read the rest of this `README.md` carefully - it contains the requirements for the project and the grading rubric that will be used to assess it.
4. Create `final-project` and `final-project-test` databases.
5. Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
6. If you navigate to [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337), you should see some UI already :) [We've provided some code to get you started]
7. Check out the mock-view in the `wireframes` folder to get an idea of what the project _could_ look like.
8. Run the tests with: `npm test`. Working through the tests is a good place to start!
9. Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
